## Overview

AgentKit is a developer platform by Volcengine that supports the building, deployment, and operation of AI Agents. It lowers the entry barrier for developers and enterprises by providing essential infrastructure beyond the model—including security, built-in tools, memory, knowledge, monitoring, and evaluation. This empowers enterprises to efficiently build, deploy, and operate complex, intelligent, enterprise-grade Agents. The platform also includes a Python SDK and a Starter Toolkit to help developers build, deploy, publish, and manage Agent applications through an SDK and CLI.

AgentKit includes the following modular Services that you can use together or independently:

## AgentKit Runtime

AgentKit Runtime is a fully managed service that provides a secure, isolated environment for running AI Agents. It supports the deployment of Agents built with any framework and language, and provides a set of APIs for interacting with the Agents.

**[Runtime Quick Start](https://volcengine.github.io/agentkit-sdk-python/content/4.runtime/1.runtime_quickstart.html)**

## AgentKit Tools

AgentKit Tools is a service that provides a set of built-in tools for AI Agents. It supports the execution of common tasks, such as data retrieval, web search, and code execution, in a secure and scalable manner.

**[Tools Quick Start](https://volcengine.github.io/agentkit-sdk-python/content/5.tools/1.sandbox_quickstart.html)**

## AgentKit Memory

AgentKit Memory is a service that provides a persistent storage solution for AI Agents. It supports the storage of Agent states, memories, and other data in a secure and scalable manner.
